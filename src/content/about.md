title: About
---
I'm a self-taught front-end developer and designer with a background in writing and journalism. Thanks to my time both in the terminal and in the newsroom, I love using code to help journalists, writers, and others tell stories on the web. I began learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript about three years ago, and since then I've picked up experience in React and Redux, Sass/SCSS, TypeScript, and Webpack.

Recently, I've taken an interest in data analysis and visualization, so over the past year I've enrolled in statistics courses at <a href="https://www.kenyon.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kenyon College</a>, where I'll be graduating in May 2019, and begun to teach myself D3.js.

This year, I've served as editor-in-chief of the <a href="https://kenyoncollegian.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Kenyon Collegian</em></a>, the weekly newspaper of Kenyon College and the village of Gambier, Ohio. There, I've led a team of about 30 staffers to produce roughly 12,000 words of news coverage every week.
