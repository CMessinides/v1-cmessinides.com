    I was responsible for the site migration and redesign of the *Kenyon
    Collegian* website in 2017. I conducted a
    [UX audit](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Site-Usability-Analysis--AYvHv1csOcmrIrpYc0920A_jAQ-yKmTaYpoVMgRe94sazrAi)
    of the old site to inform the new design, which I implemented with
    a custom WordPress theme using HTML, PHP, Sass, JavaScript, and Gulp.

    In 2017, I designed and developed the website for the *Collegian Magazine* using Middleman,
    HTML, Sass, JavaScript, and Gulp with a CMS provided by [Prismic](https://prismic.io/).
    I'm most pleased with how I was able to provide the *Magazine*'s editors
    with flexible page layouts that adapted to a variety of stories—you can find
    some examples [here](https://www.thecollegianmagazine.com/open-book/),
    [here](https://www.thecollegianmagazine.com/the-longest-line/),
    and [here](https://www.thecollegianmagazine.com/kenyon-style/).

    This is a simple app I coded using React to allow *Kenyon Collegian* readers to submit
    tips to the newspaper. It features form validation and unique styles for embedded (iframe)
    contexts. My biggest takeaway from this project was testing—I finally got a hang of TDD with Jest.

    I coded this site with Gatsby, React, and Sass. It was also my first
    experience using React Hooks. I'm especially proud of the responsive and
    accessible lightbox I developed for this site—click on one of the poster
    thumbnails below to see it in action.
